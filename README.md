# qefi

Script for simple booting of Secure Boot signed EFI binaries in qemu mainly for debugging purpose.
I implemented this for testing while debugging/fixing systemd-boot efi handover (see [#11717](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11717) and [#11772](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/11772)).
